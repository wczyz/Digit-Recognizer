# Mnist-Solver
This is a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
It consists of 3 fully-connected layers and is trained using online gradient descent.

With 200 neurons in the hidden layer and 5 epochs it achieves about 96.5% accuracy rate on the test dataset.

For the gradient descent algorithm to execute in a reasonable time, this version has 30 neurons in the hidden layer and iteration goes on only through 1 epoch.

It has about 92% accuracy.
