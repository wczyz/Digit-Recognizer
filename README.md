# Mnist-Solver
This is a simple neural network recognizing handwritten digits, trained on the MNIST dataset.
Network consists of 3 fully-connected layers and is trained using online gradient descent.

With 200 neurons in the hidden layer and 5 epochs it achieves about 96.5% accuracy rate.

For the gradient descent algorithm to execute in a reasonable time this version has 30 neurons in the hidden layer and only 1 epoch.
It has about 92% accuracy.
